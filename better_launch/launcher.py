        """Replaces a variety of special strings in the provided string, usually a path.

        This is similar to what ROS1 could do when resolving paths in XML launch files. Substitutions always have the form `$(<substitution-type> <substitution-args>)`. Substitutions can also be nested, so the following is possible:

        ``$(eval $(arg x) * 5)``  ->  if x=2, this will be resolved to 10

        Note that the underlying algorithm will likely fail if it encounters additional brackets within the string.

        The following substitutions are supported:
        * `$(find <filename> <package> <subdir>)`: return the result of :py:meth:`find`. Note that substitution arguments are always sequential (not kwargs).
        * `$(arg <name> <default>)`: return the value of an argument passed to the launch function or `<default>` if it doesn't exist. Raises KeyError if no default is provided and no default was provided.
        * `$(param <full-node-name> <param>)`: retrieves the value of the ROS parameter `<param>` from the `<full-node-name>` (i.e. namespace + node name). Raises KeyError if the node does not exist or ValueError if the node does not have the specified parameter.
        * `$(env <key> <default>)`: return the value of the environment variable `<key>` or `<default>` if it doesn't exist. Raises KeyError if no default is provided and no default was provided.
        * `$(eval <python-snippet>)`: returns the result from evaluating the provided `<python-snippet>`. Typical use cases include simple math and assembling strings. **Note** that this indeed uses python's :py:func:`eval`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        s : str
            The string to apply substitutions to.

        """Create a new ROS2 node process. The bread and butter of every ROS setup!

        Note that this method also handles lifecycle nodes (they REALLY should have a common interface). Note that especially for lifecycle nodes you probably want `autostart_process == True`, otherwise there lifecycle management will not exist. With `autostart_process == True`, a lifecycle node will automatically advance to `lifecycle_target` once it is up. Otherwise you can also call :py:meth:`Node.start` later.

        The `ROS2 documentation <https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Node-arguments.html>`_ can provide some additional information regarding `params`, `remaps`, and so on.

        Parameters
        ----------
        package : str
            The package providing the node.
        executable : str
            The executable that should be run.
        name : str, optional
            The name you want the node to be known as. If `None`, a name will be derived from `package` and `executable` and `anonymous` will be set to True.
        remaps : dict[str, str], optional
            Tells the node to replace any topics it wants to interact with according to the provided dict.
        params : str | dict[str, Any], optional
            Any ROS parameters you want to pass to the node. These are the args you would typically have to declare in your launch file. A string will be interpreted as a path to a yaml file which will be lazy loaded using :py:meth:`BetterLaunch.load_params`.
        cmd_args : list[str], optional
            Additional command line arguments to pass to the node.
        env : dict[str, str], optional
            Additional environment variables to set for the node's process. The node process will merge these with the environment variables of the better_launch host process unless :py:meth:`isolate_env` is True.
        isolate_env : bool, optional
            If True, the node process' env will not be inherited from the parent process and only those passed via `env` will be used. Be aware that this can result in many common things to not work anymore since e.g. keys like *PATH* will be missing.
        log_level : int, optional
            The minimum severity a logged message from this node must have in order to be published. This will be added to the cmd_args unless it is None.
        output : LogSink | set[LogSink], optional
            Determines if and where this node's output should be directed. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere. See :py:meth:`configure_logger` for details.
        anonymous : bool, optional
            If True, the node name will be appended with a unique suffix to avoid name conflicts.
        hidden : bool, optional
            If True, the node name will be prepended with a "_", hiding it from common listings.
        on_exit : Callable, optional
            A function to call when the node's process terminates (after any possible respawns).
        max_respawns : int, optional
            How often to restart the node process if it terminates.
        respawn_delay : float, optional
            How long to wait before restarting the node process after it terminates.
        use_shell : bool, optional
            If True, invoke the node executable via the system shell. While this gives access to the shell's builtins, this has the downside of running the node inside a "mystery program" which is platform and user dependent. Generally not advised.
        autostart_process : bool, optional
            If True, start the node process before returning from this function.
        ros_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the node to register with ROS. This should cover the time between the process starting and the node initializing itself. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the node's lifecycle management to come up. This should cover the time between the node initializing itself (see `ros_waittime`) and creating its additional topics and services. While neglible on modern computers, slower devices and embedded systems may experience a noticable delay here. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_target : LifecycleStage, optional
            The lifecycle stage to bring the node into after starting. Has no effect if `autostart_process` is False or if the node does not appear to be a lifecycle node after waiting `ros_waittime + lifecycle_waittime`.
        raw : bool, optional
            If True, don't treat the executable as a ROS2 node and avoid passing it any command line arguments except those specified.

        Returns
        -------
        Node
            The node object wrapping the node process.

        Raises
        ------

        anonymous : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be appended with a unique suffix to avoid name conflicts. `reuse_existing` will be set to False in this case.
        hidden : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be prepended with a "_", hiding it from common listings.
        autostart_process : bool, optional
            If True, start the composer process before returning from this function. Note that setting this to False for a composer will make it unusable as a context object, since you won't be able to load any components.
        ros_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the composer to register with ROS. This should cover the time between the process starting and the composer initializing itself. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.

        If you instead want to load components without a `compose` context, you should instantiate :py:class:`Component` objects directly, then load them via :py:meth:`Component.start` or :py:meth:`Composer.load_component`. See the examples for more details.

        Parameters
        ----------
        package : str
            The package providing the component implementation.
        plugin : str
            The name the component is registered as, typically of the form `<package>::<Name>`.
        name : str, optional
            The name the instantiated component should be known as. If `None`, a name will be derived from `package` and `plugin`, and `anonymous` will be set to True.
        remaps : dict[str, str], optional
            Tells the node to replace any topics it wants to interact with according to the provided dict.
        anonymous : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be appended with a unique suffix to avoid name conflicts.
        hidden : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be prepended with a "_", hiding it from common listings.
        params : str | dict[str, Any], optional
            Any ROS parameters you want to pass to the component. These are the args you would typically have to declare in your launch file. A string will be interpreted as a path to a yaml file which will be lazy loaded using :py:meth:`BetterLaunch.load_params`.
        use_intra_process_comms : bool, optional
            If True, ask the composer node to enable intra-process communication, i.e. share memory between components when passing messages instead of serializing and deserializing.
        ros_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the component to register with ROS. This should cover the time between the process starting and the component initializing itself. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the component's lifecycle management to come up. This should cover the time between the component initializing itself (see `ros_waittime`) and creating its additional topics and services. While neglible on modern computers, slower devices and embedded systems may experience a noticable delay here. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_target : LifecycleStage, optional
            The lifecycle stage to bring the component into after starting. Has no effect if `autostart_process` is False or if the component does not appear to be a lifecycle component after waiting `ros_waittime + lifecycle_waittime`.
        output : LogSink | set[LogSink], optional
            Determines if and where this node's output should be directed. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere. See :py:meth:`configure_logger` for details.

        Usually, calling :py:meth:`ros2_actions` is more convenient for queueing actions. However, calling this *first* allows to prevent starting the underlying :py:class:`launch.LaunchService` immediately, giving more control over when the actions are executed.

It will also prevent a clean shutdown as ROS usually waits for the event queue to become empty.
