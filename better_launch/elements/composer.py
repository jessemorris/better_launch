        Note that in ROS2 launch files you can reference existing composers by name when creating components. This is a clutch because ROS2 does not have a way to retrieve a reference to an already existing node. Since in better_launch we have actual node instances, referring to composers by name is not supported. Use :py:meth:`BetterLaunch.component` or construct your own component and pass a :py:class:`Composer` instance.

        Also note that since components are loaded via a service call there are some additional restrictions on the types of `params`. In particular, they must be compatible with the `ROS2 Parameter message type <https://github.com/ros2/rcl_interfaces/blob/rolling/rcl_interfaces/msg/ParameterValue.msg>`_. This is *not* verified on construction.

        In addition, note that new nodes created by a component are using the composer's remaps. See the `related issue <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2404>`_ in rclcpp.

        Parameters
        ----------
        composer : Composer
            The composer this component will be associated with.
        package : str
            The package providing this component.
        plugin : str
            The special string that can be used for loading the component.
        name : str
            The name of the component in ROS.
        namespace : str
            The node's namespace. Must be absolute, i.e. start with a '/'.
        remaps : dict[str, str], optional
            Tells the node to replace any topics it wants to interact with according to the provided dict.
        params : str | dict[str, Any], optional
            Any arguments you want to provide to the node. These are the args you would typically have to declare in your launch file. A string will be interpreted as a path to a yaml file which will be lazy loaded using :py:meth:`BetterLaunch.load_params`.
        output : LogSink | set[LogSink], optional
            Determines if and where this node's output should be directed. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere. See :py:meth:`configure_logger` for details.
